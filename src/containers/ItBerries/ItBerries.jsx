          I am a Computer Science student of Godfrey Okoye University. For
          awhile, I have always been intrigued by the websites and how they
          always come up.It wasn't until my 3rd year that I decided to try my
          luck in it and see what I could do. I realized it was something I
          really liked and I was comfortable doing it. I am also a huge fan of
          anime and I love playing video games a lot especially FPS AND RPG
          games. My goal is to become a top-notch Front-End Engineer who is able
          to consistently build user interfaces, web applications and websites.
